      "narrative": "Today, I begin my spontaneous but much-needed 5-day vacation in Greece. My wife has really been on my nerves lately, so I knew something needed to change. As a result, I took 90 grand of our joint savings to buy a first-class back-in-time trip to Athens, Greece, 441 B.C. And now here I am beginning my ascent up the Acropolis.\n\nAs I walk on the steep path, clouds of dust are created with each stride. Slowly but surely, I get closer to Propylaea of the Acropolis, that massive, recognizable monumental gateway of huge columns, and my heart begins to swell in anticipation. My wife living in the year 2025 could never bring me this much happiness.\n\nI finished walking through the smooth marble of the area surrounded by huge, towering columns to face the Parthenon, which was currently under construction. Constant yells rang out from the scaffolding. Even covered in scaffolding, the Parthenon was still a symbol of the imperial power of the Delian League. Workers, although men and consisting of citizens, foreigners, and slaves, were bustling in and out. In addition, there was a strong smell of sweat and sawdust in the air. Pretending to be a worker, I made my way past the workers and entered the Parthenon. It was a refreshing experience walking around the temple as I saw metopes, which are sculpted reliefs, each depicting various battles and art.\n\nI walked further inside and entered the naos, the inner sanctuary. I kept walking until I was blinded by a golden gleam of light. Slowly looking up, I saw a chryselephantine statue of Athena Parthenos in full glory. Adorned with ivory skin and gold clothes, my jaw dropped in utter awe as I could not help but stare at the city's ultimate financial reserve.\n\nI basked in the presence of the statue until a priest walked in and noticed me. He promptly chased me out until he gave up at the sight of descending the Acropolis.",

      "narrative": "Escaping that priest made me famished. Craving a nice, seared fish accompanied by a cup of wine, I began my walk to the Agora, the central marketplace and social hub of a city. I was surrounded by many people and carts as I walked on a road called the Panathenaic Way, an ancient ceremonial road that connected the Acropolis and the Agora.\n\nStepping into the huge open square of the Agora, I was met with a bustling, energized crowd that was constantly moving and mingling. While there was a pungent smell of people who rarely showered, I could envision my mouth-watering meal just from the overpowering smell of fresh fish and roasted garlic.\n\nPointing my nose around, I made my way towards the vendor with the strongest smell of fried fish. I noticed groups of people politely debating various interesting topics of philosophy. But I knew those topics were only distractions from my true goal of fish and wine.\n\nAfter I snagged a heavenly-smelling fried fish on a skewer and a cup of wine, I sat down on a shaded spot and took a look around. A crowd of men gathered around the kleroterion, a lottery device made to randomly choose people for public office or jury duty. With these machines, any possible way to bribe or cheat into jury duty or holding public office was effectively eliminated.\n\nI walked past the crowd of men to see another group of people that caught my attention. On small, broken shards of pottery, called ostraka, they were scratching in the names of citizens whom they wanted to be exiled for 10 years. Each broken shard counted as a vote, and the citizen who accumulated the most votes would be exiled. I picked a single shard up and scratched in my wife's name with a smile.",

      "narrative": "My smile quickly disappeared when I realized today was the Great Dionysia, one of the largest Athenian festivals that honored the god Dionysus. Today was one of those days I considered a mandatory holiday. This festival spanned over an entire week, during which the whole city had a drinking competition.\n\nAlthough a little tipsy from my cup of wine a little earlier, I knew I had something important I had to see. I eventually made my way to the southern slope of the Acropolis. From the hill of the Acropolis, a massive semicircular bowl-like stadium appeared with a U-shaped stage at its center to hold the performances.\n\nTens of thousands were already excitedly seated on the wooden benches, and more thousands were pouring into the stadium looking for just one empty seat on any bench. From a single stroke of luck, I manage to snag a seat. As I sat down, I could feel the excited anticipation of the crowd through the vibrations in the ground.\n\nI took a look around and saw people eating, rushing for seats, and some were already drunk. All chaos immediately stopped when an actor walked on the stage and cried out a poet's name with a piercing scream, 'Sophocles!' Heads started to turn. Children stopped screaming. A wave of silence enveloped the entire stadium of fifteen thousand people. Then two masked actors appeared onstage. The taller actor projected his voice with great clarity towards the crowd and said, 'Ismene, my dear sister…' Then I realized that I was not watching any play; I was watching the first-ever performance of Antigone.\n\nOne of the play's most powerful moments occurred when Antigone directly challenged King Creon's authority and said that his laws could never be compared to the 'unwritten, unshakable laws of the gods.' It was that exact moment when the audience erupted in response to her challenge. The man beside me burst into tears, while another man stood up and angrily started shouting. Once the tragedy concluded, it was a heavy, somber walk out of the theatre.",

      "narrative": "After watching that tragedy of Antigone, I needed something that could cheer me up. I have had enough of the useless therapy sessions my wife has sent me to, and I knew I needed something different that will work for sure – the words of a divine oracle. I just had this burning desire to ask Apollo a question concerning my wife.\n\nAs a result, I began my long walk north to Delphi. I hired a mule and a guide, and the 3 of us embarked on a 100-mile hike from Athens to Delphi. The roads gradually shifted from being maintained tracks to rocky, uneven slopes. The guide navigated through the 100 miles and eventually led the mule and me to the Sacred Way, a zigzagging path that leads to the Temple of Apollo at Delphi.\n\nSmall marble buildings, called treasuries, lined the sides of this road. Each treasury was a symbol of a city-state's power and wealth, as no visitor could ignore walking along it. I passed by the Athenian Treasury, a building built entirely with Parian marble to celebrate the Athenian victory against the Persians at Marathon.\n\nA shriek suddenly rang out from the Temple of Apollo. Despite the guttural shriek, an extremely long line of citizens from all different kinds of city-states who were in need of divine help stretched down the mountain. Because of the oracle, many opposed city-states unified. I, too, needed divine help, so I had no choice but to patiently wait for my turn. Just getting a meeting with the oracle typically took weeks or even months, so I could only pray to Tyche, the goddess of luck, that my wait time would be as short as possible.\n\nIt was not until a couple of hours later that one of the priests noticed I was a foreigner, saying, 'Oh! A foreigner who must see the Oracle!' He immediately took hold of my right arm and pulled me out of the line. One of the locals shouted, 'That's not fair!' I smiled in gratitude as I was led deep into the adyton, the restricted inner chamber.\n\nSuddenly, the priest stopped in front of a dimly lit room illuminated by a couple of oil lamps. In the middle of the room was the Pythia, the oracle, and a priest standing nearby to interpret her words. Despite her ominous moans and convulsions as she inhaled vapors rising from the chasm beneath her, I asked my question, 'Will my wife divorce me for taking out 90 grand for this trip?' The oracle responded with a series of convulsions and shrieks, to which the priest wrote down a sentence. It said, 'Mucho gracias, amigo.' I screamed at the priestess in anger, but I had no choice but to accept the fact that I was scammed.",

      "narrative": "Getting scammed did not stop me from reaching my final destination: the Olympic Games. From Delphi to Olympia, the trip took roughly a week, as I had to hike down from Mount Parnassus to the port of Kirrha and purchase a fare to take a boat across the Gulf of Corinth to the Peloponnese.\n\nThe boat ride was followed by another hike through Elis before I finally reached the stadium of Olympia. I was stunned. As far as my eyes could see, roughly 40 thousand people were roaring at what was happening below. However, despite the size of the stadium, there were no benches like at the Theatre of Dionysus. From the top to the bottom of the grassy slopes encompassing the track, tens of thousands took their humble spot.\n\nI found my empty patch of hardened dirt to sit down so I could watch the ongoing pankration, an ancient Greek combat sport similar to modern MMA. Down below, two sweaty men covered in dust and sand, who could probably decimate entire villages with their bare hands, were going at each other.\n\nThe shorter, muscular one launched a kick aimed at the taller one's head. Upon impact, the smack of the leg against the head had a deep, wet thud, and the crowd cheered even louder. As the taller one stumbled to the side, dazed by that powerful kick, the shorter one took the opportunity to drive his elbow with full force into the taller one's stomach. The taller one let out a piercing cry of pain before crumbling to the ground. The crowd then erupted in response to the brutal end of the fight.\n\nI then realized that the crowd was not just cheering for violence, they were cheering as the fighters demonstrated arete, the Greek pursuit of individual excellence. But once the fight ended, so did my journey in Greece. I know I have one last pankration with my wife.",
